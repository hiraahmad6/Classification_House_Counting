# Classification_House_Counting

Just run Classification.ipynb code in the Classification folder

There are 3 classes zeros as lower dataset, ones as mid dataset and twos as high dataset

The classification has been done on these three classes


Adding one more feature to this project, to draw annotations over the images
For this I have uploaded annotations in the same repository

Extract all the zip files and place the extracted folders in the same directory i.e., 6 folders will be placed in that 
directory

high_train_dir
high_test_dir
low_train_dir

mid_train_dir
